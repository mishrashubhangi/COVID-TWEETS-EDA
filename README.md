NLP Enabled Citizen Engagement Tool (NECET) is a web app for determining the emotions of the citizens across various subject matters, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, thus allowing the government to get insights about the public mind set.The project is primarily based on the concept of Geotagging based Sentiment Analysis.Consequently, the project paves the way for the government and many organizations to address the situations that has led to instances of mass hysteria and panic due to the outbreak of corona.As of now, I have successfully scraped the tweets using the python library twython.Parameters used for scraping the tweets are geolocation,date range,keyword,count and time required(to scrape the tweets).Besides, I have also designed the machine learning learning pipeline for data pre-processing and sentiment analysis for a given query along with the graph for sentiment over days.
